# Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct version 2.1. By taking part, you agree to uphold this code.

## Our Pledge
We pledge to make participation in the Mini project a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, gender identity and expression, experience level, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Showing empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, experiences, and viewpoints
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Accepting responsibility and apologizing to those affected by mistakes, and learning from the experience

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- The use of sexualized language or imagery, and sexual attention or advances of any kind
- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information (such as physical or email address) without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub issues, pull requests, discussions, reviews, documentation, and community channels) and also applies when an individual represents the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by contacting the maintainer privately via the email address listed on [@A-Akhil](https://github.com/A-Akhil)'s GitHub profile or by requesting a private conversation in the relevant GitHub issue. All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of the reporter and any individuals involved.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Maintainers will follow these Community Impact Guidelines when determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

1. **Correction**
   - *Community Impact*: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome.
   - *Consequence*: A private, written warning from maintainers, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.
2. **Warning**
   - *Community Impact*: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.
   - *Consequence*: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in project spaces as well as external channels like social media.
3. **Temporary Ban**
   - *Community Impact*: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.
   - *Consequence*: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time.
